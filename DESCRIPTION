Description: Universally unique identifiers ('UUIDs') can be suboptimal
        for many uses-cases because they aren't the most character
        efficient way of encoding 128 bits of randomness; v1/v2 versions
        are impractical in many environments, as they require access to a
        unique, stable MAC address; v3/v5 versions require a unique seed
        and produce randomly distributed IDs, which can cause
        fragmentation in many data structures; v4 provides no other
        information than randomness which can cause fragmentation in many
        data structures. 'ULIDs' (<https://github.com/ulid/spec>) have
        128-bit compatibility with 'UUID', 1.21e+24 unique 'ULIDs' per
        millisecond, are lexicographically sortable, canonically encoded
        as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character 'UUID',
        use Crockford's 'base32' for better efficiency and readability (5
        bits per character), are case insensitive, have no special
        characters (i.e. are 'URL' safe) and have a onotonic sort order
        (correctly detects and handles the same millisecond).
